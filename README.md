# VermontDomesticViolenceStory
This is a journalistic and data-driven story about the journey of a survivor of domestic violence in Vermont written for publication in the VTDigger. 

When thinking about what we wanted to focus on when writing this story about domestic violence in Vermont, we want to look at how COVID-19 affected the support available for survivors of domestic violence. And we also wanted to include a bit of background information about what domestic violence is and what it is like for a survivor to find support.

There are many types of abuse that go on within an intimate relationship. Verbal coercion or threats can turn into slapping or hitting, which can then escalate to causing serious injuries to the victim such as concussions and broken bones.

After years of being belittled and intimidated, victims of abuse internalize the words said to them by their partners and begin to believe the insults as true. They feel trapped emotionally, psychologically and economically.

Leaving an abuser is not just an event, it is a process. Each survivorâ€™s journey is unique and important to their quality of life in the future. Having to find a way to support themselves after escaping the abuse they had endured can become another level of isolation for survivors. It can be a terrifying journey.

We had the chance to talk to a survivor about her own experience escaping her abuser. And this is the story we share through our project.
